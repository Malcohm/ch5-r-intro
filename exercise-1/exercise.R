# Exercise 1: practice with basic R syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

> hometown <- "Brunei" # hometown refers to the city I was born in

# Assign your name to the variable `my_name`

> my_name <- "Malcohm" # refers to my name

# Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my_height`

> my_height <- 68.4 # refers to my height in inches

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have

> puppies <- 1 # puppies refers to the number of puppies I'd like to have

# Create a variable `puppy_price`, which is how much you think a puppy costs

> puppy_price <- 300 # refers to cost of one puppy

# Create a variable `total_cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

> total_cost <- 300 # refers to the total cost of puppies

# Create a boolean variable `too_expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater 
# than $1,000

> too_expensive <- 1000 # refers to if the cost of puppies are greater than 1000
> total_cost > too_expensive #returns logical value FALSE (total_cost is not bigger than too_expensive)

# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can 
# afford for $1,000

> max_puppies <- 3 #refers to the number of puppies I can afford for $1,000
